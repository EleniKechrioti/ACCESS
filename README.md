##  Overview

ACCESS provides a holistic experience for both everyday users and city authorities. It allows users to:

- Discover the most accessible routes.
- Report obstacles or issues in real time.
- View detailed feedback, photos, and accessibility tags.
- Get personalized suggestions via geo-push notifications.
- Help the community by validating or contributing to crowdsourced data.

Meanwhile, public institutions can:

- Monitor accessibility stats via Power BI dashboards.
- Export data for analysis and reporting.
- Intervene faster in urban mobility issues.

It also has an mobile aplication for admins, where they can:
  - View reports uploaded by users
